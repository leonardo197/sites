                <code>display</code> is CSS's most important property for controlling layout. Every element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default for most elements is usually <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>. A block element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always just called an inline element.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content">block</h2>
            <div class="elem">
                <span class="label">&lt;div&gt;</span>
                <p>
                    <code>div</code> is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Other common block-level elements are <code>p</code> and <code>form</code>, and new in HTML5 are <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>section</code>, and more.
                </p>
                <span class="endlabel">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>inline</h2>
                <p>
                    <code>span</code> is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph
                    <span class="elem elem-inline"><span class="label">&lt;span&gt;</span>
                        like this
                        <span class="endlabel">&lt;/span&gt;</span></span>
                    without disrupting the flow of that paragraph. The <code>a</code> element is the most common inline element, since you use them for links.
                </p>
                <h2>none</h2>
                <p>
                    Another common display value is <code>none</code>. Some specialized elements such as <code>script</code> use this as their default. It is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without really deleting and recreating them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is different from <code>visibility</code>. Setting <code>display</code> to <code>none</code> will render the page as though the element does not exist. <code>visibility: hidden;</code> will hide the element, but the element will still take up the space it would if it was fully visible.
                </p>
                <div style="display:none;">You found me!</div>
                <h2>other display values</h2>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of more exotic display values, such as <code>list-item</code> and <code>table</code>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/display">Here is an exhaustive list</a>. We'll discuss <code>inline-block</code> and <code>flex</code> later on.
                </p>
                <h2>extra credit</h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned, every element has a default display type. However, you can <em>always</em> override this! Though it wouldn't make sense to make an inline div, you can use this to customize the display of elements that have particular semantics. A common example is making inline <code>li</code> elements for horizontal menus.
